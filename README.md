# Zypher Agent - Local Job Tailor

A simple local AI agent built in Node.js/TypeScript to analyze job descriptions and provide tailored skills, summary, and cover letter recommendations. This project runs entirely locally—no external API required.

## Features

- Load job descriptions from terminal input or `sample-jd.txt`
- Generate skills, technologies, a summary, and a cover letter
- Save results locally to `results.json`
- Fully offline, mock AI agent for demonstration

## Files

- `main.ts` - Main agent code
- `sample-jd.txt` - Sample job description
- `results.json` - Generated output after running the agent

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bennysai14/Zypher-agent.git
cd Zypher-agent

You can paste a job description or type sample to use the provided sample-jd.txt.

The output is saved to results.json.

Files

main.ts - Main program

sample-jd.txt - Sample job description

results.json - Output file generated by the agent

Notes

This is a mock agent, no real LLM is required.

Node.js and ts-node are required for TypeScript version.
