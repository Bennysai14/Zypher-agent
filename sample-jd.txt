We are looking for a Web Developer/Designer to help train and improve cutting-edge AI models. You’ll assess and enhance how AI systems understand, generate, and evaluate design work — including interfaces, layouts, visuals, and user experiences.

In this role, you’ll use your design expertise to:
- Evaluate AI-generated design outputs
- Provide detailed feedback
- Refine the model’s sense of aesthetics, usability, and creative quality

Your insights will directly shape how the next generation of AI tools supports designers.

This is a new and growing area for our company — focused on teaching AI to better understand visual and design principles.

At this stage, designers should apply through our general core assessment and then complete a qualification for Web & UI/UX Design. Once approved, you’ll not only have access to general AI training projects but also be invited to contribute to design-specific projects.

These projects focus on:
- UI/UX critique
- Product visuals
- Aesthetic evaluation
- Presentations and creative deliverables

Benefits:
- Full-time or part-time REMOTE position
- Choose which projects to work on
- Work on your own schedule
- General AI training projects start at $20+ USD/hr
- Design-focused projects start at $40+ USD/hr
- Bonuses for exceptional work

Responsibilities:
- Review and critique AI-generated UI/UX designs, mockups, and visuals
- Evaluate AI model output for correctness and performance
- Help train models to better understand aesthetic quality and user-centered design

Qualifications:
- Fluency in English (native or bilingual level)
- Background in UI/UX design, web design, product design, or graphic design
- Strong understanding of visual hierarchy, interaction design, and user flow
- Excellent command of grammar, style, and brand voice
- Bachelor’s degree preferred but not required

Additional Notes:
- Payment is via PayPal
- No money will ever be asked from you
